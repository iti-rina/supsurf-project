# Landing page for SUP rental service

It's a simple landing page so HTML, CSS and only vanilla JS were used here. Now it's available on http://sup19.ru

## Deployment

I was made all the entire deployment process by myself:

- created Yandex Compute Cloud and configured it;
- set up Nginx server;
- worked with domain name and DNS.
